- Now player can eat/be eaten by other players according to teams.
- While being eaten, player will disapear in a smoke screen and reappear as a member of the eater's team.
- game is now playable online (closed beta as for now will set up open beta server later).
- 3 levels of quality setting are now available (default is medium).
- Cleaned code.

Fixes:
- position calculation is now correct, despite the fact you can see a 'teleportation'
from other player they still go at the same speed.
- Fixed some laggy methods.

Knows issues:
- If two players are on the same map screen and one of them is to pass to another one,
the second one will have his/her map background changed as well while still being on the
current map.
- If a player try to change direction before the end of the movement animation, he/she will
have a small freeze of about 0.1 second or less before starting moving again, this is because the
animation must finish before allowing player to move again.
